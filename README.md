## Tensorflow Errors

Some Windows users face the following problem:

```sh
Error: The specified module could not be found.
\\?\C:\Users\<username>\...otherpathstuff\InterChat\node_modules\@tensorflow\tfjs-node\lib\napi-v8\tfjs_binding.node
```

A simple fix would be to copy `node_modules/@tensorflow/tfjs-node/lib/napi-v9/tensorflow.dll` into `node_modules/@tensorflow/tfjs-node/lib/napi-v8/`. Everything should work fine after that. (just use linux frfr)
