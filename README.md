# ChatBot-Alpha

## Discord Intent Questions:
### Application Details
Chatbot is a growing bot which provides an inter-server chat. The inter-server chat crosses the boundary constraining servers to only talk amongst itself. The developers are also working hard to make sure that the chat is free from NSFW and other un-family-friendly things.

# Message Content Intent
### WHY DO YOU NEED THE MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT?
We require this intent to display messages for our inter-server feature. Without it the main purpose of the bot will not function properly. The data stored will be deleted every 30 minutes or so to save space.
