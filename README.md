# ChatBot-Beta

## TODO, REVIEW, NOTE, and FIXME comments:
1. `TODO` - Something that must be finished before releasing, a reminder.

2. `REVIEW` - Review a piece of code to see if there is a better alternative.

3. `FIXME` - To change later to avoid facing problems, a bug that must be fixed before release.

4. `NOTE` - A note left for later, something important or something that shows how something is supposed to be used/works.
